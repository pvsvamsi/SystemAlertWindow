  # To add assets to your plugin package, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # To add custom fonts to your plugin package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
#  fonts:
#    - family: Montserrat
#      fonts:
#        - asset: assets/fonts/montserratRegular.ttf
#        - asset: assets/fonts/montserratSemiBold.ttf
#          weight: 700
#        - asset: assets/fonts/montserratMedium.ttf
#          weight: 800
#        - asset: assets/fonts/montserratBold.ttf
#          weight: 900
